ITSA Web Site
2018-10-24

Some General Points
* Build from scratch.  We are not building on the current web site.
* Expect to use text and image elements from the current web site.
* Maybe use the same color scheme.  Some familiarity.
* It will be a static web site.  No database back-end.
* There may be JavaScript to support some user interaction.
* We could do some server-side scripting with PHP.  Maybe some dynamic pages.
* We do need input and content from the ITSA advisors.
* It’s a web site.

What image elements can we expect to reuse?
* Logo * Does ITSA need a new logo?
* Icons * I have seen the PNG files.  They need to be optimized.
* Advisor Pics

Proposed changes.
* The page header should use less vertical space.
* The navigation bar will use less space if laid out horizontally.
* Removing the vertical navigation box, more room is available for real page content.
* The Google based ITSA Event box does not need to be on every page.
* Change fonts.
* Change normal text to a larger font size.
* Reduce the large margin areas.  Use more space in the web browser view.
* Maybe float the ITSA Events box to the right.
* Add a footer to contain the typical footer elements.
* Add "Membership" to the nav bar.
* Add "FAQ" to the nav bar.
* The home page is out-of-date.  Prevent the display of events that are in the past.

Proposed footer elements
* Copyright
* Contact Us
* About Us
* E-mail Us
* Facebook
* Linked-in
* Subscribe to Newsletter
* Link to LCC main page
* Link to Class Schedule PDFs

New Images Needed
* Header background
* Body background?

More Ideas
* Can we combine ITSA and CIT event lists?
* Add more information content.  More pages.
* A page for available employer contacts (if allowed).
* A page for suggestions to faculty members.
* A page of available documents.  PDFs to appear in a PDF view.  Materials from past presentations.
* A page for opportunities at LCC.
* A page for opportunities in the community.
* A page for job opportunities.
* Somewhere list conference opportunities
* The site should be updated on a regular basis, so the information content is up-to-date.
* Give the date and time of the next meeting.  
* If you want me at a past meeting, give me a time machine.
* Show fundraising items in visibly separate boxes.  Two items will look like two items.
* Improve the presentation of fundraising item information.
* Form input items on the Contact Us page can be sized more appropriately.
* Replace the mail address text, "lcc-itsa@mail.lcc.edu", with a mailto link.
* Provide a page for the CIT web site to link to.
* The HOME page might list and explain the menu/nav items.  Tell them what to expect.
